This is how Experiment 3.1 were conducted

Steps:

1. Run the Data_prep.py file, which converts the data_3D.pickle file to a folder of exercises.

2. Run TrainTest.py to split the Dataset. A file called Dataset Split is thus produced.

3. Run the ST_GCN_1.py model. This file is the ST-GCN model.

4. Run Loading_and_Training.py, which loads Dataset_split and trains the ST-GCN model.
